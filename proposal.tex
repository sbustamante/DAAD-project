\section{Abstract}
%==============================================================================


The cosmic web is one the most striking features of the Universe, being 
predicted by theory, widely tested by observations and studied through 
simulations. Currently, dark matter-only simulations is one of the best tools 
we have for understanding the cosmic web. Nevertheless, recent works about 
filamentary gas accretion, acquisition of angular momentum of galaxies and spin 
orientation have proven the need of using full hydrodynamic simulations. 
Incorporating gas dynamics in simulations is far from an easy task, and 
traditionally used hydro-solvers present important accuracy problems. Recently, 
a completely new paradigm was implemented in the \texttt{AREPO} code, which 
combines the strength of previous schemes and overcomes their weaknesses, making
it a very attractive choice for simulating the large-scale Universe. Despite 
this, no much work has been done in studying the gaseous cosmic web and its 
impact on galaxy evolution using \texttt{AREPO} simulations, so that is the 
main objective of this PhD project.

\section{Introduction}


The filamentary nature of the large-scale matter distribution (the so-called 
cosmic web) is one of the most striking features of Universe \citep{Bond96}, 
being an essential part of the current standard paradigm in cosmology. Last 
generation galaxy redshift surveys, such as the \textit{two-degree-Field Galaxy 
Redshift Survey} (2dFGRS, see \citet{Colless03}) and the \textit{Sloan Digital 
Sky Survey} (SDSS, see \citet{Abazajian09}), have revealed the cosmic web at a 
level of detail never seen before. In addition, other observational probes like
the Ly-$\alpha$ forest in distant quasars \citep{Rauch98, Cantalupo14}, 
fluorescence emissions \citep{Cantalupo12} and weak gravitational lensing 
\citep{Massey07, Dietrich12} have also validated this picture undoubtedly.

\

On the theoretical side, early descriptions of the evolution of the large-scale
Universe, based on gravitational instabilities in primordial stages and leaded 
by the seminal work of \citet{Zeldovich70}, predict the cosmic web picture. 
Since then, our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the cosmic web 
has been dramatically improved as new and more powerful theoretical and 
computational tools and better observational data become available. In 
particular, N-body simulations, fuelled by last generation computing systems 
and ever more efficient numerical algorithms, have an increasingly important 
role in revealing the complexity of the large-scale Universe.

\

In the current cosmological paradigm, the $\Lambda$CDM model, there are two 
different types of matter, i.e. baryonic or luminous matter, corresponding 
to what we can see, and the poorly interacting (and of a still unknown nature) 
dark matter. The most actual measurements of their abundances indicate a 
proportion approximately of 1 to 6, respectively \citep{Planck13XVI}. 
Accordingly, most of the related numerical research has been made based on 
dark matter-only N-body simulations, where the gas dynamics has been 
neglected (for a very detailed numerical analysis of the dark matter cosmic 
web, see \citet{Cautun14}). Nevertheless, recent simulation studies in 
filamentary gas accretion in high redsfhit galaxies \citep{Dekel09}, 
large-scale orientation and alignment of the spin of galaxies with they 
embedding cosmic web \citep{Hahn10}, and filamentary-induced exchange of 
galaxy angular momentum \citep{Dubois14}, have proven the need of using 
fully hydrodynamical cosmological simulations due to the high level of coupling
between dark and baryonic matter.

\

Incorporating gas dynamics into cosmological simulations is far from an easy 
task. The first reason is the highly complex \textit{gastrophysical} processes 
involved in baryonic dynamics, i.e. shock heating, photoionization, supernova 
feedback, stellar wind, radiative cooling, star formation \citep{Bond93}. The
second reason is the complexity of the hydrodynamical equations followed by 
the gas. Traditionally, two different hydro-solvers have been used for this 
task, i.e. a Lagrangian \textit{Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics} (\texttt{SPH}) 
technique \citep{Monaghan92} (for an implementation, see e.g. the \texttt{GADGET} 
code by \citet{Springel05}) and an Eulerian solver on a mesh with \textit{
Adaptive Mesh Refinement} (\texttt{AMR}) \citep{Berger89} (for an implementation, 
see e.g. the \texttt{RAMSES} code by \citet{Teyssier02}). 

\

The \texttt{SPH} scheme is easily implemented on a computer due to its 
Lagrangian character. Furthermore, as the mesh follows the evolution of each 
single particle and has a continuously auto-adjusting resolution, its usage is 
very suitable for problems like turbulent flows. However, its same Lagrangian 
nature originates an inhomogeneous and distorted spatial resolution, what makes 
difficult to account for low density regions in simulations and causes 
suppressions in fluid instabilities, making it poor suitable for capturing shock
dynamics. An artificial viscosity term is usually introduced for improving the 
accuracy in these situations. On the other hand, \texttt{AMR} is more efficient 
for capturing shock dynamics. However, due to the conservative nature of the 
hydrodynamical equations, a fixed mesh causes a lack of Galilean invariance, 
making the computer implementation considerable harder. Furthermore, the 
unsmooth sampling of physical properties introduces spurious vorticity to the 
fluid, making the scheme unsuitable for studying turbulent flows (for a further
discussion and comparison of both schemes, see \citet{Plewa01}).

\

Recently, a completely new paradigm was introduced by \citet{Springel10} and 
implemented in the \texttt{AREPO} code. It combines the strengths of 
\texttt{AMR} and \texttt{SPH} but overcoming their weaknesses. This code uses 
a moving mesh based on a Voronoi tessellation defined over a set of particles
that represents the fluid. The geometry of the mesh resembles very closely that 
of the point distribution, avoiding a distorted spatial resolution and 
retaining the auto-adaptivity inherent of \texttt{SPH}. Unlike \texttt{AMR}, 
the hydro-solver of \texttt{AREPO} is based on a Gudonov's scheme with an exact 
Riemman solver that guarantees the Galilean invariance and the conservative 
nature of the solutions. All of these features makes \texttt{AREPO} highly 
efficient and accurate for simulating a plethora of hydrodynamical problems, 
even including those where \texttt{AMR} and \texttt{SPH} fail separately. Hence 
\texttt{AREPO} is a very attractive approach for computing fully hydrodynamical 
simulations of the large-scale Universe.

\

Using a hydrodynamical simulation (\footnotesize{\texttt{HORIZON-AGN}}
\normalsize) computed through the \texttt{RAMSES} code, \citet{Dubois14} 
studied the alignment between the spin of galaxies and filaments above redshift
one. They found a redshift-dependent stellar mass threshold above which 
high-mass galaxies are misaligned with filaments, while low-mass galaxies are 
aligned. On the other hand, \citet{Hahn10} also studied this problem by mean of 
a \texttt{RAMSES} simulation, but finding a completely different result, 
high-mass galaxies are aligned while low-mass galaxies are misaligned with 
their embedding filaments. Related to highly efficient star forming galaxies at 
high-redfhits, \citet{Dekel09} proposed a new scenario where the filamentary 
accretion of cold gas streams enhances the star formation rate. This is a very 
interesting alternative to the merger scenario, where star forming rates are 
propelled by violent collisions of galaxies. The new picture is consistent
with the observed properties of those galaxies, where there can be found 
relatively intact rotating disks. All this shows the current interest in 
studying the impact of the gaseous cosmic web on galaxy evolution in the light 
of \texttt{AREPO} simulations, where it is necessary to conciliate and study 
deeper existing results and predict new ones.

\section{Objectives}
%==============================================================================


\begin{itemize}

\item[\checkmark] Studying gaseous filamentary accretion of the cosmic web using 
\texttt{AREPO} simulations.

\item[\checkmark] Quantifying the impact of gaseous filamentary accretion on 
galaxy evolution.

\item[\checkmark] Deriving observable quantities from our theoretical studies.


\end{itemize}



%==============================================================================
\section{Methodology}
%==============================================================================


The proposed project is subject to a PhD study and will cover the following 
aspects:


\begin{itemize}

\item[\checkmark] \textit{First, an analysis and characterization of existing 
hydrodynamical simulations based on the \texttt{AREPO} code will be done.}

\end{itemize}


As this project will be entirely based on numerical results, an analysis and 
characterization of existing \texttt{AREPO} hydrodynamical simulations is one 
of the key steps. This includes a quantification of the dark matter and the 
gaseous cosmic web through two different web finding schemes (i.e. the T-web 
based on the tidal tensor \citep{Hahn07,Forero09}, and the V-web based on the 
velocity shear tensor \citep{Hoffman12}, schemes in which prof. Jaime 
Forero-Romero has a wide research trajectory); thus voids, walls, filaments 
and clusters will be identified. Then, a statistical analysis of the found 
structures will be carried out, i.e. volume and mass filling fractions at 
different redshifts, morphology, halo populations and filamentary accretion of 
gas.


In Heidelberg, the required computer facilities and access to existing 
simulations and the private \texttt{AREPO} code (of which Prof. Volker 
Springel is the main author) is granted. Moreover, the renowned research 
trajectory and expertise of Prof. Springel in numerical cosmology is 
certainly another appealing for pursuing this specific PhD project.


\begin{itemize}

\item[\checkmark] \textit{Second, detailed simulations of specific process at
high redshifts will be computed.}

\end{itemize}


Once analysed the gaseous cosmic web, we proceed to compute its impact on 
galaxy evolution, specially at high-redshifts due to the big amount of 
available observational constrains. This step involves computing new high 
resolution \texttt{AREPO} simulations in order to study specific processes 
like: star formation rate enhanced by filamentary gas accretion, angular 
momentum exchange between galaxies and the cosmic web, spin orientation of 
galaxies along filaments and walls.


\begin{itemize}

\item[\checkmark] \textit{Third, new observables will be derived based on the
results of the simulations. }

\end{itemize}


At this point, we will compare our theoretical results with available 
observational data of the cosmic web, specially at high redshifts. This step 
will also involve deriving new observables based on our predictions.

\section{Current State}
%==============================================================================


At present the applicant has already the fundamental basis in Astrophysics and
Cosmology required for this investigation. This can be confirmed by his research
trajectory, including a paper (as co-author) published in the \textit{ApJL} in 
which was studied the kinematics of the Local Group in a cosmological context, 
another paper (as co-author) published in the \textit{ApJ} where was studied 
the influence of thermal evolution in the magnetic habitability of rocky planets, 
and some participations in academic congresses. Furthermore, a Bachelor's thesis
\footnote{\scriptsize Further information and an electronic version of this 
thesis can be found here \url{https://github.com/sbustamante/Thesis}.} where was 
studied the preferred place of simulated Local Group-like systems in the cosmic 
web, also proves the ability of the applicant for handling simulations and massive 
data, a skill that is necessary for carrying out this project.

\

Currently, the applicant is also involved in two research projects: first, a 
new method for finding voids in simulations based on the local fractional 
anisotropy. An ongoing publication (as first author) related to this is about 
to be submitted. \footnote{\scriptsize Information of this paper can be found 
here \url{https://github.com/sbustamante/CosmicVoidsPaper}.}. The second project
involves a comparison of three simulation techniques, i.e. \texttt{SPH} vs 
\texttt{VPH} vs \texttt{AREPO}, with possible publishable results at the end of
the present year \footnote{\scriptsize Further information in  
\url{https://github.com/sbustamante/MethodsComparison}.}.
